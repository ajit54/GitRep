Test Data Management

Test Data Management consists of managing the provisioning of required test data efficiently and effectively, while at the same time ensuring compliance to regulatory and organizational standards.
It provides integrated sensitive data discovery, business classification, and policy-driven data masking for de-identification and safe use of production data used in test and development environments. TDM can be deployed on premises, in the cloud, and via hybrid cloud configurations.
•	TDM creates targeted, "right-sized" subsets faster and more efficiently than cloning.
•	Easily refresh, rest and maintain test environments.
•	Compare data to pinpoint and resolve application defects faster
•	Accelerate release schedule.
